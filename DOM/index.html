    <title>Intro to DOM Manipulation</title>
</head>
<body>
<!-- DOM stands for Document Object Model
 - Allows our JS to interact with the HTML & CSS of our page
 - Specifies how browsers should create a model of an HTML page and how JS can access and update the contents of a web page while it is in the browser's window

DOM is a document representation of a webpage, which can be modified with a scripting language like javascript

TWO PRIMARY FUNCTIONS:
1. Making a model of an HTML page
    - when the browser loads a webpage, it creates a model of the page in memory.
    - the DOM specifies the way in which the browser should structure the model in what is called the DOM tree.
    - DOM is called an object model, because DOM tree is made of objects.
2. Accessing and changing the HTML page
    - the DOM also provides methods and properties to access and update each object in the model, this updates what the user sees in the browser.

Usually when working with the DOM tree we will access an element we want to work with and then we will modify or manipulate it.

ACCESSING: 
    COMMON METHODS FOR ACCESSING A SINGLE ELEMENT:
         - getElementById()
         - querySelector()
    COMMON METHODS FOR ACCESSING MULTIPLE ELEMENTS:
         - querySelectorAll()
         - getElementByClassName()
         - getElementByTagName()

MANIPULATING: property because there are no ()
    COMMON METHODS FOR WORKING WITH HTML CONTENT:
         - innerHTML
         - textContent
         - createElement
    COMMMON METHODS FOR WORKING WITH TAG ATTRIBUTES:
         - className or just id - depending on if we are altering a class or an id (className reserved in JS)
         - setAttribute()
         - getAttribute()

                        <!-- ! SECTION 3 -->
<button id="clickThis">Click!</button>
<button id="clickThis2">Click!</button>
<button id="clickThis3">Click!</button>

<!-- SECTION 4 -->
<label for="nameInput">Enter your name: </body></label> <br />
<input type="text" id="nameInput" placeholder = "Your name here">
<br />
<hr />


<!-- 
    We can write javascript directly in our html page by typing it within a <script> tag, similar to how we would write this in a <style> tag within CSS
 -->
 <!-- <script>
     //now we can write some javascript
    console.log('Hello from the script tag~!');
 </script> -->

<!-- What if we want to use an external javascript file in this webpage? -->
<!-- Best practice to link at the bottom of the body because it reads top to bottom -->

<script src='script.js'></script>
