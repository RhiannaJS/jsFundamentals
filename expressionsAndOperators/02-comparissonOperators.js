//COMPARISON OPERATORS

//EQUAL
'3' == 3;
console.log('3' == 3);
/*
Javascript is helpful and does something know as coercion when comparing 
values.
-coercion is the process of converting a value  from one type to another
-in the above example, javascript assumed that we are trying to check if 
'3' is equal to 3, even though one of our values is a string and one is an
integer
*/

//STRICT EQUAL - This overrides javascripts coercion
console.log(3===3);//true
console.log('3'===3); //false

// NOT EQUAL - !(bang) means not equal
console.log('3'!= 3);//false

//STRICT NOT EQUAL
'3' !== 4;
console.log('3' !== 4);

//GREATER THAN
3 > 2;

//LESS THAN
2 < 3;

//GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO
3 >= 2; //NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH => (fat arrow functions, which we will explore later)

//LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO 
2 <= 3;

// AND
2 && 3;

// OR
2 || 3;
